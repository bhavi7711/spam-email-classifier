# Spam Email Classifier

This project implements a machine learning model to classify email messages as either "spam" or "ham" (non-spam). Using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques, this classifier is built to filter out unwanted emails from important ones.

## Project Description

Spam emails are a major issue in the digital world, overwhelming inboxes with irrelevant content. The purpose of this project is to build an automatic spam email classifier using machine learning techniques to detect spam emails.

The classifier is trained using the **Naive Bayes classifier** along with **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** vectorization for feature extraction. This approach uses labeled data to train the model, which is then able to predict whether a new email is spam or not.

## Requirements

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x
- `scikit-learn`
- `numpy`
- `joblib`
- `pandas` (for data handling)
- `matplotlib` (for visualizations, optional)

You can install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
